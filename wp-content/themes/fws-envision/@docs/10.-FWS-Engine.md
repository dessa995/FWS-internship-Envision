FWS Engine is a default part of this Starter Theme to which **the Starter relies on heavily**.

See `fws` and `fws/src` for its structure and features.

List of Starter **default features** and **classes**:

- `Config\Config` - parse `.fwsconfig.yml` and expose values.
- `Theme\Hooks\BasicSetup` - add basic theme setup and theme supports.
- `Theme\Hooks\CustomSetup` - handle Starter custom features.

## WooCommerce Support

All WooCommerce functionality overrides should be written in
 - `fws/src/WC/Render.php` and
 - `fws/src/WC/Hooks.php` files.

All WooCommerce template overrides should be written in the `woocommerce` directory.

Before implementing any template overrides, all templates of the **current plugin version** should be **backed up** in the `woocommerce/__templates-backup` directory.

**This is important to do because if the WooCommerce plugin is updated, you will lose original templates and will not be able to compare any overrides that need updating as well.**

The `woocommerce` root directory should **only contain** files that are being overridden. **By all means, do NOT ever copy the entire template structure to this folder**.

## Contact Form 7 Support

Contact Form 7 FWS extension enables usage of HTML and [MJML](https://mjml.io/) files for creating form and email templates.

All CF7 functionality overrides should be written in
 - `fws/src/CF7/Hooks`file.

For admin dashboard:
 - `src/config/admin/js/admin/cf7.js` and
 - `src/config/admin/scss/_cf7.scss` files.

**The drawback of the CF7 plugin is that all HTML needs to be written inside the dashboard.**

This creates obvious issues when it comes to version control, there is no way to keep this HTML structure on a Git repository, and there's an unnecessary risk that the database gets lost along with whole written HTML and CSS for forms and emails.

To resolve this problem, Starter comes with a feature that enables writing custom HTML files for creating CF7 form and usage of MJML templating engine for creating emails.

With this in mind, the following workflow should be implemented:
 - All HTML for CF7 form should be written using `.html` format in `src/emails/cf7` directory.
 - All HTML for CF7 emails should be written using `.mjml` format in `src/emails/cf7` directory.

**Note that all `.html` files will be copied over to `dist/cf7` directory, and all `.mjml` files will be compiled into HTML to the same `dist/cf7` directory.**

After everything is configured and created inside a project's theme, new options for CF7 will be available.

As seen in the screenshot, all fields for creating forms and emails are **locked**, and a new tab, `FWS CF7 Templates`, is available.

There, we can choose which templates we want to use for an appropriate dashboard field.

![](http://fwsinternaladm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cf7-temokates.png)

Once selected, entire HTML content will be copied over to appropriate fields.

**Make sure the form is saved before leaving the page** as this feature only prepopulates the content and not actually saves it.

**Another important thing to note**, before the HTML is appended to proper fields in CF7 dashboard, the entire HTML is run through `lodash.template` compiler to cover any dynamic content such as **theme root path** and **site url**.

The avalible **variables** are:
 - `themeRoot` - will return theme's root path,
 - `siteUrl` - will return site's url.

The syntax for placing these variables is `<%= siteUrl %>`.

    Example:

    <mj-button href="<%= siteUrl %>">Go To Website</mj-button>
    <mj-image src="<%= themeRoot %>/src/assets/images/fws-logo-red.png"/>

![](http://fwsinternaladm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cf7-compiled.png)

The examples above show that these variables will compile to proper values pulled from the WP database.

Lastly, the entire feature can be disabled by simply changing the `.fwsconfig.yml` option `cf7-custom-templates` to `false`.

## Custom Post Types and Taxonomies

Registering custom post types and taxonomies must always be done using FWS Engine.

Each custom post type with belonging taxonomies must be placed in a single file inside
the `fws/src/CPT` directory. If custom post type is a part of a broader business logic, then it would
make more sense to put it into its own namespace, which better describes that feature or component.
If you are using a different folder structure, make sure that the namespace reflects that.

Always use the `ExampleCPT.php` example file located in the `__examples-and-snippets` directory. Copy the file to
the `fws/src/CPT` folder and make sure you rename both the file and the Class. Both should be exactly
the same.

The naming format of these files should be followed like this - `CPTBooks.php`, so essentially, the `fws` directory should have this path:

    fws/src/CPT/CPTBooks.php

Use `$postConfig` and `$taxConfig` array variables to configure names of custom post types and taxonomies.

Example:

    private $postConfig = [
        'singularName' => 'Custom Post',
        'pluralName'   => 'Custom Posts',
        'dashIcon' => 'dashicons-admin-post'
    ];

    private $taxConfig = [
        [
            'singularName'  => 'Custom Post Category',
            'pluralName'    => 'Custom Post Categories',
        ],
        [
            'singularName'  => 'Custom Post Attribute',
            'pluralName'    => 'Custom Post Attributes',
        ]
    ];

Methods within the CPT class will handle `$postConfig` and `$taxConfig` variables to pull appropriate names,
labels and generate a slug.

Slug and Nice Name are based on the singular name of a custom post type or taxonomy.
FWS will replace any space characters for `_` or `-` characters and add appropriate prefixes when needed.

Slug is used for registering custom post types or taxonomy under this name. It will use the `_` character and a prefix.

Nice Name is used for URL structure. It will use a `-` character and will not include a prefix.

Prefixes are defined as follows:
- for a post type: `cpt_`
- for a taxonomy: `ctax_`

Example:

    private $postConfig = [
        'postSingularName' => 'Book',
        'postPluralName'   => 'Books'
    ];

    private $taxConfig = [
        [
            'singularName'  => 'Book Category',
            'pluralName'    => 'Books Categories',
        ]
    ];

This will result in custom post type and taxonomy being registered under the slugs:

    cpt_book
    ctax_book_category

and it will set `rewrite` rules for pretty URLs using Nice Name conversion:

    somedomain.com/book/post-title
    somedomain.com/book-category/category-title

For the rest of a custom post type and taxonomies configuration, see functions:

- `cptInit()`
- `cptInitTax()`

Always make a new function for additional taxonomies for a custom post type.

When needing a taxonomy that is shared across multiple post types, create a separate class file.

To init CPT class, it must be included and initialized in the `FWS.php` file.


**In `FWS.php` file:**

    <?php
    declare( strict_types = 1 );

    ...
    use FWS\CPT\CPTBooks as CPTBooks;

    protected function __construct()
    {
        ...

        // Theme CPTs
        CPTBooks::init();

        ...
    }

## Utilities

List of all helper functions from this Starter Theme:

- `templateView()` - *Renders template component or part with configured array variable that maps out template view's variables. The method expects configured array, file name, and boolean to toggle directory from template-views/component to template-views/part.*
- `linkField()` - *Renders ACF link field with all field params.*
- `inlineSVG()` - *Renders an inline SVG into any template.*
- `postedOn()` - *Prints HTML with meta information for the current post-date/time and author.*
- `pagingNav()` - *Outputs the paging navigation based on the global query.*
- `assetsSrc()` - *Render image src from 'src/assets/images' or `__demo` directory.*
- `mediaItemRegular()` - *Render image media wrapper `div` as well as `img` with all proper modifer and helper classes.*
- `mediaItemStatic()` - *Does same as `mediaItemRegular`, but it's configured to pull static theme assets.*
- `mediaItemLazy()` - *Does same as `mediaItemRegular`, but with additional options for lazy loading.*
- `newImageSize()` - *Create a new image size on 'on fly'.*
- `varDump()` - *A better way to `var_dump()` stuff.*

All helper functions are defined as methods in defined classes that are all loading from the **fws/FWS.php** file.

Each method is available through instances of the FWS class and instances of other classes located in the *fws/src* directory.

Example:
```
fws()->render()->templateView( $data, 'banner' );
echo fws()->images()->assetsSrc( 'dog-md.jpg', true );
echo fws()->acf()->linkField( $button, 'banner__btn btn' )

```

For a full description of each method, see appropriate files and examples in the theme.
