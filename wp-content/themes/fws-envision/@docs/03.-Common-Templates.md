## Working with Common Template Files

Below is a list of some basic theme templates and files found in the Starter Theme:

- **index.php**
    - The main template file. It is required in all themes.
    - Any page that does not have a template file created for it will default to this one.
- **home.php**
    - The home page template is the front page by default. If you do not set WordPress to use a static front page, this template shows the latest **Blog** posts.
- **single.php**
    - The single post template is used when a visitor requests **any** single post, in case a post type doesn't have a specific template file for it.
    - For example, if a custom post type Books doesn't find a template file named **single-book.php**, it will default to this one.
    - In general, templates for single posts **should always** be created for **specific post type** as in the Book example above.
    - Alternatively, it can use this universal **single.php** file, but with conditional rendering handled within.
    - The example below shows conditional loading of template view for single **Blog** post:
        - `if ( get_post_type() == 'post' ) { get_template_part( 'template-views/blocks/blog-single/blog-single' ); }`
    	- `else { get_template_part( 'template-views/shared/content', get_post_type() ); }`
- **page.php**
    - The page template is used when visitors request individual pages, which are a built-in template.
    - The Starter Theme uses this template **exclusively for ACF Flexible Content**.
- **category.php**
    - The category template is used when visitors request **Blog** posts by category.
- **archive.php**
    - Uses much of the same logic and rules as the **single.php** template file.
    - The archive template is used when visitors request posts by taxonomy term, author, or date.
    - Just like with **single.php**, this template will be overridden if more specific templates are present like **category.php**, **author.php**, **date.php**, etc.
    - This rule obviously expands to a post-type specific template. For example, a custom post type Books will use **archive.php** if it can't find **archive-book.php**.
    - Same as before mentioned file, archive templates **should always** be created for **specific post type** as in the Book example above, unless a conditional rendering logic is written in the base template itself.
- **taxonomy.php**
    - Uses exactly the same logic and rules as the **archive.php** template file, but is specific for a custom taxonomies.
    - In other words, this is the taxonomy term template that is used when a visitor requests a term in a custom taxonomy, where no specific template file is provided.
    - For example, if a custom taxonomy Book Categories doesn't find a template named **taxonomy-book-category.php**, it will default to this one.
    - Furthermore, if the **taxonomy.php** template file is also not present in the theme, it will default to **archive.php**.
    - This is why it is **important to always** provide specific template files or implement conditional rendering in universal ones.

To learn more about common WP template files, see the links below:
- https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/
- https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/

Considering all of the above and the fact that WP for a given situation:
- will look for **taxonomy-book-category.php**
- and if not found, will look for **taxonomy.php**
- and if not found, will look for **archive.php**
- and if not found, will look for **index.php**,

It is clear why the suggested **workflow for specific template files is important** when working on complex projects that include **multiple custom post types and taxonomies with different designs and layout**.

To promote these guidelines, even more, **another** workflow **rule should always** be followed.

**ALL Common Template Files should NOT contain ANY HTML and should always be written exclusively with PHP.**

    Example: archive-book.php

    <?php
    get_header();
    do_action( 'fws_starter_s_before_main_content' );

    $book = [
        'title'    => get_the_archive_title(),
        'subtitle' => get_the_archive_description()
    ];
    fws()->render()->templateView( $book, 'book-listing', 'listings' );

    do_action( 'fws_starter_s_after_main_content' );
    get_footer();
