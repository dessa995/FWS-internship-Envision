## Installation Instructions
Install FWS CLI globally.

This only needs to be done once per machine, so if you installed it previously, skip this step.

Although, keep in mind for the most recent version of it: [@fws/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fws/cli).

    npm i @fws/cli -g

Install JS dependencies by running [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) package manager.

    npm install

Install PHP dependencies by running [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) dependency manager.

    composer install

Install [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) WordPress plugin as the Starter Theme depends on it. Works better with the PRO version.

## Starter Config

Use the`.fwsconfig.yml` file to configure top-level theme options.

### Global Config

- `theme-name` - set theme full name
- `superadmin-emails` - set the fatal error handler email address from admin's to our internal
- `plugins-only-local-editing` - enable only superadmins to add/update/remove plugins/themes on server
- `acf-only-local-editing` - enable acf to edit and manage only on local enviorment


    global:
        theme-name: 'FWS Starter _S'
        superadmin-emails:
            - 'nick@forwardslashny.com'
            - 'mirosalav@forwardslashny.com'
            - 'dusan@forwardslashny.com'
        allowed-localhosts:
            - '.local'
            - 'localhost/'
            - '.lndo.site'
        plugins-only-local-editing: true
        acf-only-local-editing: true

#### Local Virtual Host

Local environment **needs** to be declared in a `.env` file in order for the project to work properly.

`.env` file is on git ignore list, but there's also a`.env.example` file that should be cloned and renamed to `.env`.

With this in mind, every team member can be free to name their virtual hosts whatever they want to.

    VIRTUAL_HOST_URL=http://project-name.lndo.local/

### ACF Fields Config

More details about `acf-options-page` and `acf-flexible-content` in the **Using Components** section, **Managing Options pages** sub section.

### Styleguide Config

- `pages` - set list of all pages defining
- `colors` set list of all colors, matching
- `icons` - set list of all SVG icons
- `fonts` - set list of all fonts, matching variables in scss file
- `titles` - set list of all special titles defining their classes and dummy text
- `buttons` - set list of all buttons defining their classes and dummy text


    styleguide:
        pages:
            -
                title: 'FE Homepage'
                url: '/fe-homepage/'
        colors:
            - 'black'
            - 'white'
        icons:
            - 'ico-arrow-up'
            - 'ico-arrow-down'
        fonts:
            -
                name: 'Open Sans'
                class: 'font-main'
        titles:
            -
                text: 'This is Page Title'
                class: 'page-title'
        buttons:
            -
                text: 'Normal'
                class: 'btn'

Styleguide page **will automatically load** any `_fe-` prefix files.

**This is why it is important to name any variation files using `--` extension to the filename.**

For example:
- default file name: `_fe-banner.php`
- variation file name: `_fe-banner--alt.php`

### Styles and Scripts Version

Note that after `fws build` the `.fwsenqueue.yml` file is generated.

This file is on the `.gitignore` list and is generating a timestamp after each **build**.

This **timestamp** is used as a version control for compiled files, that is, for styles and scripts that are enqueued in the theme.
