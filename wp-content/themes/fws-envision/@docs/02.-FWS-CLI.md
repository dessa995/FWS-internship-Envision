## W3 Validator

To run W3 Validator locally, execute the `fws w3 local` command.

    fws w3 local

HTML validity is checked with [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) API.

This command will only work if the local environment and virtual host are declared in the `.env` file in the property `VIRTUAL_HOST_URL=http://project-name.lndo.local/`.

**This is a must**, your virtual host URL **must be** declared in this manner in order for W3 to work.

Furthermore, W3 Validator has the **only** command that **can be run outside** of the Starter Theme's root directory.

The command for checking any **online/live** URL is:

    fws w3 https://somedomain.com/

Note that you need to pass an actual domain URL as an argument.

The domain URL **needs to be very strictly formatted**. It needs to start with `http` or `https` and needs to end with `/`.

## Working with Components Template Files

### Working with PHP Template Views

#### Creating Template Views

There are four types of template views:
- Blocks
- Listings
- Parts
- Shared

To create a new view, execute the `fws create-file` command and pass `--block`, `--listing` or `--part` with an argument.

    fws create-file block-name --block
    fws create-file listing-name --listing
    fws create-file part-name --part

Alternatively, it is possible and **recommended** to use short aliases.

    fws cf block-name -b
    fws cf listing-name -l
    fws cf part-name -p

Note that in this case the options argument is passed with one '-' instead of two '--'.

This command will create new module files in appropriate directory `template-views/blocks`, `template-views/listings` or `template-views/parts`:
* .php
* .scss

It will also update appropriate scss file `_blocks.scss`, `_listings.scss` or `_parts.scss` in `src/scss/layout` directory.

**Note:** There are no CLI commands for creating Shared type template views.

#### Deleting PHP Frontend Template Views

Once done with the FE development phase, it is required to delete all FE components from the `template-views` directory.

To remove them all, execute `fws remove-fe`

    fws remove-fe

Alternatively, it is possible and **recommended** to use short aliases.

    fws rfe

This command will delete all `.php` files in appropriate directory `template-views/blocks` or `template-views/parts` with `_fe-` prefix.

### Working with Vue Components

#### Creating Vue Components

To create a new Vue component, execute `fws creates files` command and pass `--block-vue` or `--part-vue` with an argument.

    fws create-file block-name --block-vue
    fws create-file part-name --part-vue

Alternatively, it is possible and **recommended** to use short aliases.

    fws cf block-name -B
    fws cf part-name -P

Note that in this case the options argument is passed with one '-' instead of two '--'.

This command will create new module file in appropriate directory `src/vue/components/blocks` or `src/vue/components/parts`:
* .vue

#### Naming Conventions

The naming convention for Vue files should be as follows:
- each component should be named using PascalCase format,
- each block component should have a prefix 'Block',
- each part component should have a prefix 'Part'.

It is essential to keep in mind these rules when creating the files manually.

When using the `create-file` or `cf` command, these rules will be applied automatically.

    Example:
    fws create-file team --block-vue

    or short:
    fws cf team -B

    Will create:
    src/vue/components/blocks/BlockTeam.vue
