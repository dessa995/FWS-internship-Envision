## General Setup

With modular template views, ACF Flexible Content must be organized and implemented in a defined manner.

**Moving away from default Flexible Content implementation...**

**... and make full use of Clone field.**

![](https://fwsinternaladm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/flex-content-new.png)

**Each Flexible Content block will use the Clone field to copy ALL fields from a certain field group.**

![](https://fwsinternaladm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/flex-content-groups.png)

Making those fields direct subfields in Flexible Content layouts.

Using this system translates very well when it comes to passing Flexible Content values to template views.
Instead of using ACF basic loop, it is required to use the standard PHP switch method in a for-each loop.

```
foreach ( get_field( 'content' ) as $fc ) {
  switch ( $fc['acf_fc_layout'] ) {
    case 'banner':
      fws()->render()->templateView( $fc, 'banner' );
      break;
    case 'slider':
      fws()->render()->templateView( $fc, 'slider' );
      break;
    default:
      fws()->render()->templateView( $fc, 'basic-block' );
  }
}
```

In the example above, it is **important to note** that variable that is being passed to the *templateView()* function **is not set** as an array-like in the previous example, but rather simply passed the current item from the loop.

The reason this is possible is because of **the way ACF values are natively returned**. Meaning, ACF fields are **always stored and returned as an array**.

Naming fields with the same names as variables in the template views will ensure that each component gets properly formatted array values needed for rendering properly.

## Using JSON

The idea behind this approach of modular ACF fields is to take full advantage of ACF [Local JSON](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/local-json/).

Inspiration for this workflow was drawn from this [post](https://www.awesomeacf.com/how-to-avoid-conflicts-when-using-the-acf-local-json-feature/). Although it has nice ideas, it still doesn't resolve the issue when two developers work on the same field groups. In such a scenario **a conflict of JSON files is inevitable**.

The main goal is to **allow multiple developers** to work on field groups simultaneously in a local environment, with **lowest possible risk** of having conflicts in generated JSON files.

Splitting each Flexible Content block into a separate field group optimizes the workflow to allow more developers to work in parallel. There is still a risk of creating a conflict if two developers are editing the same field group, but in this workflow, chances for that are slim.

It is essential to have JSON generating enabled, which is an option set by default.
Another thing to keep in mind, since these fields are being used exclusively for cloning purposes, it is important to set them as **inactive**.

![](https://fwsinternaladm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/acf-inactive2.png)

To optimize the workflow even further, this Starter Theme comes with hook function **that will automatically sync any changes** in field groups registered by new JSON files.

For example:
- Developer A makes changes in field group Banners.
- Developer B pulls changes into his local environment. The ACF field groups will get synced and updated on the first dashboard load as the internal script detects JSON files changes.

Lastly, it is necessary to **avoid any conflicts** coming from any changes **made directly on development or live server**. To resolve this, Starter Theme actually comes with another hook **which disables** any field group editing on any other environment, **forcing developers** to make all changes exclusively on **local environment**.

## Naming conventions and categorizing

The workflow above resolves many problems, but it does have a **small drawback**, creating each block's fields as a separate field group **will result in too many groups** in the dashboard.

Furthermore, it is highly recommended also to create **helper groups** of fields that can be cloned in other block's fields.

For example, the Section Title field...

![](https://fwsinternaladm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/re-acf.png)

... can be reusable across many different field groups.

![](https://fwsinternaladm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fc-acf.png)

Considering **helper group** fields together with **block group** fields, the number of groups in the dashboard will tend to get **very long and unorganized**.

To resolve this issue, this theme comes with a Custom Taxonomy **"Categories"** for the ACF plugin, which **should** be used to group the field groups together.

Aside from using field group categories, it is also **required to follow defined naming convention**.

Every field group for **blocks** should be named with a **prefix 'FC'**.
Every field group for **reusable elements** should be named with a **prefix 'RE'**.

![](https://fwsinternaladm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/acf-categories.png)

With these two conventions, it is visually optimized to distinguish which fields are blocks and which helpers, and it is user-friendly to use categories to filter out desired groups.

## Managing Flexible Content field

With everything above fully implemented, the **last thing** to tackle is the **Flexible Content** field and potential conflicts, which are still **not covered** by the defined workflow.

Cloning separate field groups into Flexible Content blocks **resolves to avoid JSON conflicts** when multiple developers are working **on a separate components (field groups)**. However, it is still **necessary** for each developer **to edit the same field group for Flexible Content** and make changes simultaneously, creating an inevitable JSON conflict.

**Final step** in this workflow is to actually **avoid creating/editing** any **Flexible Content** group fields from the dashboard and make those changes through the `.fwsconfig.yml` file.

Starter Theme has more helper functions to enable just that, but it is **important to follow the proper formatting** of the `.fwsconfig.yml` file.

All values must be written under `acf-flexible-content` with defined **group name** as property name that includes the following sub-properties.

**The Starter Theme will automatically load any defined group names, unless the `autoload` property is disabled.**

- `autoload`
    - Set whether or not to autoload this flexible content group.
    - If set to `false`, you'll need to use the function directly in code somewhere to enable the field group.
    - The function in question is `addNewFlexContentGroup($fc);` that is located in **fws/src/ACF.php**.
- `field-name`
    - Filed name that will show on the page.
    - See image **Field Name** below.
- `location`
    - `param` Set to what type this field group will be for.
    - `value` Set to what type this field group will equal to.
    - Set location where this field group will load.
    - See image **Field Location** below.
    - Some of the possible values:
        - "post_type": "post"
        - "page_template": "default"
        - "taxonomy": "category"
        - "options_page": "fws_starter_s-settings"
    - For more information on available values, please refer to [ACF Docs](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/)
    - **Important Note**: Currently, the conditional logic for `param` and `value` is set to equal (`"operator": "=="`). This is hardcoded withing the theme, in order to expand this option and flexibility of `.fwsconfig.yml`, please reffer to `addNewFlexContentGroup` and `registerFlexContent` methods in *fws/src/ACF.php*.
- `hide-on-screen`
    - Set rules for default meta fields that should be hidden on a page.
    - See image **Field Hidden Stuff** below.
    - All possible values:
        - permalink
        - the_content
        - excerpt
        - discussion
        - comments
        - revisions
        - slug
        - author
        - format
        - page_attributes
        - featured_image
        - categories
        - tags
        - send-trackbacks
- `layouts` set flex content layouts/blocks that will show for this group
    - `title` This is the name that will show in the flex content dropdown. It can be set arbitrarily.
    - `group_id` This must be set to field group id/key value.
    - See images **Field Layout Title** and **Field Layout Group ID** below.

**Example of .fwsconfig.yml**:

    acf-flexible-content:                               # DEFINE ACF FLEXIBLE CONTENT GROUPS AND FIELDS
        default-page-template:                          # define flexible content for default page template
            autoload: true                              # set whether or not to autoload this flexible content group
            field-name: 'Content'                       # filed name that will show on page
            location:                                   # set location where this field group will load
                param: 'page_template'
                value: 'default'
            hide-on-screen: [ 'the_content' ]           # set rules for default meta fields that should be hidden on a page
            layouts:                                    # set flex content layouts/blocks that will show for this group
                -
                    title: 'Banner'
                    group_id: 'group_5d70e7dfa2562'
                -
                    title: 'Basic Block'
                    group_id: 'group_5d70e7ea08bce'
                -
                    title: 'Slider'
                    group_id: 'group_5d70e7f775076'
                -
                    title: 'Vue Block'
                    group_id: 'group_5dcd6b37b67a4'

To sum up, all Flexible Content group fields must be defined as **arrays of an array**.

In the example above, Flexible Content group `default-page-template` is an array value of `acf-flexible-content`.

To register more than one Flexible Content group, it is necessary to simply add another array into `acf-flexible-content`.

**Example of .fwsconfig.yml** that is showing three Flexible Content groups for different post types:

    acf-flexible-content:
        default-page-template:
            autoload: ...
            field-name: ...
            location: ...
            hide-on-screen: ...
            layouts: ...
        blog-page-template:
            autoload: ...
            ...
        product-page-template:
            autoload: ...
            ...

## Managing Options pages

Keeping in mind the workflow we have for Flexible Content, it is safe to assume that a very similar approach is used for ACF Options pages, so just like in the examples above, it is **important to follow the proper formatting** of `.fwsconfig.yml` file.

All values must be written under `acf-options-page`:

- `enable`
    - Set to `true` or `false` in order to enable ACF Options Main page.
    The Menu Item's name in the Dashboard will be the of the theme set in `global` property, `theme-name` sub-property.
- `subpages`
    - Takes on an array of strings, which will be used to create sub-pages of ACF Options.
    - See image **Subpages** below.
    - Leave empty array if no subpages are needed - `subpages: []`.

***Sub pages***

![](https://fwsinternaladm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/acf-options.png)

**Example of .fwsconfig.yml**

    acf-options-page:
        enable: true
        subpages:
            - 'Mega Menu'
            - 'Shared Sections'
