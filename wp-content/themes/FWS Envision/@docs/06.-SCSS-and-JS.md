## SCSS

All Template Views styles should be written in the corresponding directory.

All Vue Components styles should be written in `.vue` files.

All global styles should be written in `src/scss` directories.

- For project's global styles everything should be written in `src/scss/site.scss` file and it's imported files.
- For dashboard's global styles everything should be written in `src/scss/admin.scss` file and `src/scss/admin` directory.

Any styles for JS plugins should be imported from node_modules. No direct copy/pasting plugin styles should be practiced in the theme.

    Example: site.js

    @import '../../node_modules/@fancyapps/fancybox/dist/jquery.fancybox';
    @import '../../node_modules/select2/dist/css/select2';
    @import '../../node_modules/perfect-scrollbar/css/perfect-scrollbar';
    @import '../../node_modules/slick-carousel/slick/slick.scss'; //sass-lint:disable-line clean-import-paths

CSS code quality is checked with [Sass Lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint).

## JS
As this is a WP theme, by default, it relies on the jQuery library.

Global JS scripts should be written in `src/js` directories.

- For the project's global scripts, everything should be invoked from the `src/js/site.js` file.
- For the dashboard's global scripts, everything should be invoked from the `src/js/admin.js` file.

The file `site.js` and `admin.js` should contain all load methods, and serve for invoking the script's init methods.

    Example: src/js/site.js

    import Menu from './_site/menu';
    import Sliders from './_site/sliders';

    jQuery(function() {
        Menu.init();
        Sliders.init();
    });

All other files should be organized following this folder structure:
- `site` - contains all scripts for a site.
- `admin` - contains all scripts for WP dashboard.
- `shared` - contains all scripts that are shared between `site.js` and `admin.js`.

Vue JS scripts and logic should be written in appropriate files in the `src/vue` directories.

Any JS plugins should be installed and imported using NPM. No direct copy/pasting plugin scripts should be practiced in the theme.

For general availability, import in `site.js` or `admin.js` file.

    Example: src/js/site.js

    import 'bootstrap/js/src/util';
    import 'bootstrap/js/src/scrollspy';
    import Menu from './site/menu';
    import Sliders from './site/sliders';

    jQuery(function() {
        Menu.init();
        Sliders.init();
    });

Note that we can also import just chunks of packages that we need (as seen above with Bootstrap), meaning we might not want to import an entire library if we only need just a piece of it.

For plugins that are needed per script basis, simply import in a proper script file.

    Example: src/js/site/sliders.js

    const $ = jQuery.noConflict();
    import 'slick-carousel';

    'use strict';
    const Sliders = {
        ...
    }

JS code quality is checked with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
