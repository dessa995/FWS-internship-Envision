## Preloading Fonts

All font files that are used in a project should be preloaded in the header file.

Do **NOT** use a large number of font files in a project. Always consult with a designer to reduce file usage and bring it down to an essential minimum.

 Make sure only `.woff2` versions are preloaded.

	<link rel="preload" href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/src/assets/fonts/OpenSans-Bold.woff2" as="font" crossorigin />
	<link rel="preload" href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/src/assets/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.woff2" as="font" crossorigin />

## Loading Assets

### Loading Everything in Header

The Starter Theme changes default WordPress behavior regarding loading scripts and styles, right out of the box, and moves loading off all scripts to the header.

Looking at `moveAllScriptsToHeader` method located in `fws/src/Theme/Assets/SiteAssets.php` file, we can notice that all asset loading is moved from `wp_footer` to `wp_head` hook.

This means that it has become **irrelevant what value is passed** to the `$in_footer` argument in the function [wp_enqueue_script](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/) when using it.

**Keep this in mind when working with third-party plugins.**

### Cleaning Header from Other Crap

By looking at the `fws/src/Theme/Hooks/HeadRemovals.php` file, we can see that many default unnecessary scripts and links are cleaned up and removed.

These methods will:

- Remove RSS Feed from WP head.
- Remove REST API link from WP head.
- Remove XML-RPC RSD link from WP head.
- Remove WordPress version number from WP head.
- Remove wlwmanifest link from WP head.
- Remove shortlink from WP head.
- Removing prev and next article links from WP head.
- Disable the emojis.
- Remove from TinyMCE.

### Localizing JS Objects with PHP Values

In the `fws/src/Theme/Assets/SiteAssets.php` file, a localized object is already bound to all Starter's scripts under the name of `fwsLocalized`.

Edit the `init` method in the file to add more properties to the `fwsLocalized` global JS object.

## Deferring All Scripts

All scripts for The Starter Theme **have `defer` attribute** added to them.

**This includes WP's `jQuery` script as well.**

Keeping in mind that `jQuery` is loading as a deferred script, all other scripts must use the `defer` attribute as well. Any plugin, which by default adds a new script without deferring it, must be addressed and modified to load it properly with `defer`.

This can be done by simply adding the script's name to the array variable located in the `fws/src/Theme/Assets/DeferAssets.php` file.

## Conditional Loading and Removing Unnecessary Scripts

### Removing Unnecessary Scripts

Out of the box, The Starter Theme will eliminate loading of the following default scripts:

Site's scripts in `Theme/Assets/SiteAssets.php` file:

- `jquery-migrate`,
- `wp-block-library`
- `wp-block-library-theme`
- `wp-embed`

Plugin's scripts in `Theme/Assets/PluginAssets.php` file:

- `wc-block-style` *(woocommerce)*
- `wc-block-vendors-style` *(woocommerce)*

### Loading Scripts Conditionally

Any scripts that get appended to the DOM via plugin **must be** wrapped up in a conditional statement that will prevent their loading on any pages that do not need them.

In the example above, we are removing WooCommerce scripts on all pages except the ones where they are needed. This will drastically boost the performance of an entire site since we just removed at least 4 scripts from loading on most pages.

Also, note that there is a double `if` statement as we **always** want to check first if the plugin is actually activated. Using the `function_exists` method for this purpose is a good practice.
